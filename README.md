## Overview


 * Here is a link to the live demo: https://customey.onrender.com/

 * This is a clone of the popular social media site Meet-Up

 * A few things I learned:
    * How to build React components and how they work with Redux to display data. 
    * How to create thunks for Redux to retrieve data from the back end. 
    * Ways to ensure a shallow copy of an object is created to update the application's state. 
    * How to reuse a component. The Group and Event display are both the same component with a lot of flow control. 

 * A few skills I improved upon: 
   * Creating React components. 
   * Using Redux to manage application state. 
   * Creating RESTful endpoints for the back end. 
   * Validating incoming data from the frontend.
